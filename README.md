## Vancouver Public Library - World Languages
The Vancouver Public Library is the third largest public library system in all of Canada. VPL has 20 branches in several locations spread across Vancouver & a central library. The central library carries material (books, e-books, DVDs, audio-books, magazines etc.) in several world languages - i.e., international languages other than English. The branches carry international language collections which are more representative of the demographics in that particular region

This project aims to scrape the website of Vancouver Public Library using automation test software in order to study the international language collection carried by each VPL location. In addition, the automated tool will scrape more than 70K+ records to gather information on the specific language collection, title, author, category, availability status and ratings of international material to draw insights. The motivation for the project stems from a general curiosity in reading, languages & an interest to explore the resources available in my locality
